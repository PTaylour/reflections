*What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?*
- creates the .git file which holds all the repo info


*How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?*
- no files like the working directory, no commits like the respository. 
- space to organise what will make up the next commit
- allows you to craft a commit into something meaningful
